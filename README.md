We designed this application using Callback Hell method.
In this application, first we display the countdown from 10 to 1 and atlast "HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY" gif will be displayed.
We've written the logic inside an arrow function that will be passed as an argument in setInterval method.
In 1 millisecond difference,countdown and text/image/gif will be displayed on the document.
